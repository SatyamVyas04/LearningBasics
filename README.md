# LearningBasics
> (Apr'20 - Today)

Welcome to the **LearningBasics**! This repository serves as a collection of basic programs written in various programming languages. It's not a project or application, but rather a personal space where I've saved programs while learning different languages and concepts. Whether you're a beginner or just curious, feel free to explore the code snippets and get a glimpse of my coding journey.

## Languages Covered

This repository contains code snippets for the following languages:

- Python
- Java
- C
- C++

## Credits

While these programs are primarily for my learning, I'd like to acknowledge the resources that have helped me along the way:

- **Python**: Many thanks to [Mosh Programming](https://codewithmosh.com/) and [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5) for their excellent tutorials and guidance in learning Python.


## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each programming language. Inside each folder, you'll find individual program files corresponding to different topics or concepts.

Feel free to explore, learn, and experiment with the code. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or spot any errors, I'm open to your feedback!

## Usage

You're welcome to use the code snippets for your own learning, experimentation, or reference. Keep in mind that these programs are meant to be educational and may not cover every aspect of the language or concept.

## Contribution

Since this repository is a personal learning space, I'm not actively seeking contributions. However, if you spot any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or send a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for visiting the Learning Playground! I hope you find the code snippets helpful in your own coding journey. Remember, programming is all about exploration and learning, so have fun and keep coding!
