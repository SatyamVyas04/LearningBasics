/*
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

operand_1: 7 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3
operand_2: 5 -> 7 -> 4

result: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7
